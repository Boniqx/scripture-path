"<h3>Historical Context</h3><p>The prophecies concerning the Suffering Servant in Isaiah were written during a time of great upheaval and uncertainty for the nation of Israel. Isaiah ministered primarily during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (see <bible-verse reference='Isaiah 1:1'>Isaiah 1:1</bible-verse>). The Assyrian empire was a major threat, and the people of Israel faced moral and spiritual decline. These prophecies offered hope amidst despair, pointing towards a future deliverer who would suffer for their sins.</p>"
